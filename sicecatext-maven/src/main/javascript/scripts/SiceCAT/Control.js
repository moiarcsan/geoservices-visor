/**
 * Class: SiceCAT.Control
 * Controls affect the display or behavior of the map. They allow everything
 * from panning and zooming to displaying a scale indicator. Controls by 
 * default are added to the map they are contained within however it is
 * possible to add a control to an external div by passing the div in the
 * options parameter.
 * 
 * Example:
 * The following example shows how to add many of the common controls
 * to a map.
 * 
 * > var map = new OpenLayers.Map('map', { controls: [] });
 * >
 * > map.addControl(new OpenLayers.Control.PanZoomBar());
 * > map.addControl(new OpenLayers.Control.MouseToolbar());
 * > map.addControl(new OpenLayers.Control.LayerSwitcher({'ascending':false}));
 * > map.addControl(new OpenLayers.Control.Permalink());
 * > map.addControl(new OpenLayers.Control.Permalink('permalink'));
 * > map.addControl(new OpenLayers.Control.MousePosition());
 * > map.addControl(new OpenLayers.Control.OverviewMap());
 * > map.addControl(new OpenLayers.Control.KeyboardDefaults());
 *
 * The next code fragment is a quick example of how to intercept 
 * shift-mouse click to display the extent of the bounding box
 * dragged out by the user.  Usually controls are not created
 * in exactly this manner.  See the source for a more complete 
 * example:
 *
 * > var control = new OpenLayers.Control();
 * > OpenLayers.Util.extend(control, {
 * >     draw: function () {
 * >         // this Handler.Box will intercept the shift-mousedown
 * >         // before Control.MouseDefault gets to see it
 * >         this.box = new OpenLayers.Handler.Box( control, 
 * >             {"done": this.notice},
 * >             {keyMask: OpenLayers.Handler.MOD_SHIFT});
 * >         this.box.activate();
 * >     },
 * >
 * >     notice: function (bounds) {
 * >         OpenLayers.Console.userError(bounds);
 * >     }
 * > }); 
 * > map.addControl(control);
