<div id=Content><div class="CClass"><div class=CTopic id=MainTopic><h1 class=CTitle><a name="SiceCAT.Handler"></a>SiceCAT.<wbr>Handler</h1><div class=CBody><p>Base class to construct a higher-level handler for event sequences.&nbsp;  All handlers have activate and deactivate methods.&nbsp;  In addition, they have methods named like browser events.&nbsp;  When a handler is activated, any additional methods named like a browser event is registered as a listener for the corresponding event.&nbsp;  When a handler is deactivated, those same methods are unregistered as event listeners.</p><p>Handlers also typically have a callbacks object with keys named like the abstracted events or event sequences that they are in charge of handling.&nbsp;  The controls that wrap handlers define the methods that correspond to these abstract events - so instead of listening for individual browser events, they only listen for the abstract events defined by the handler.</p><p>Handlers are created by controls, which ultimately have the responsibility of making changes to the the state of the application.&nbsp;  Handlers themselves may make temporary changes, but in general are expected to return the application in the same state that they found it.</p></div></div></div>
